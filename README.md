Recommend getting the go extension for vscode.
Go has a built in linter/formatter

Get go and make if you don't already have them

brew install go make
```

Run the application with

```bash
go run ./cmd
# Eg. use the 'pull' command
go run ./cmd pull
```

Build the application with

```bash
# in the project directory
make
# run binary directly
./_output/bin/mf
```
