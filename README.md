# tbd

Recommend getting the go extension for vscode.
Go has a built in linter/formatter

Get go and make if you don't already have them

```bash
brew install go make
```

Run the application with

```bash
go run ./cmd
```

Build the application with

```bash
# in the project directory
make build
# run binary directly
./_output/bin/tbd
```
